LocalGuru
=========

Find local Gurus on a map.

This project is made for a site called [BuurtLinux][1], a Dutch site meant to find people who can
help others with Linux. 

Goal of buurtlinux.nl
=====================

In 2011 the site buurtlinux.nl has been handed over to "[Nederlandse Linux Gebruikers Groep][2]"
(Dutch for: "Dutch Linux User Group", in short: NLLGG) by the original author, Ruud Beukema. Since
then it is hosted and maintained by NLLGG.

It's goal is to allow people to offer their support for Linux, either voluntarily or commercially,
in their own neighbourhood/city. When someone seeks help with installation or otherwise usage with
the Linux operating system, they can find if someone locally offers that.

Goal of LocalGuru
=================

NLLGG has put the source code online, since it was already licensed with GPLv3 and NLLGG really
wants to enable improvements being made to the project. The goal of the project is to enable those
in need of help to be able to find someone who can help them.

Eventually LocalGuru should be easy to install and maintain, flexible, translatable and usable for
all kinds of Gurus (e.g. Linux-gurus, beer-gurus, knitting-gurus, etcetera).

Status
======

The code is **not production-ready** and in need of a lot of TLC, which we hope to receive from
FLOSS community's.

We are searching for people who are willing to contribute to this project and make it a great tool
for community's. Meanwhile being aware of the current state of the code. None the less, we are
certain there is great potential for this project. 

Take a look and give us feedback at the [issue-tracker][3].
